<!-- Operator Precedence
Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.

Example -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Multiplication has precedence over addition.</p>

<p>100 + 50 * 3</p>
<p id="demo"></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Multiplication has precedence over addition.</p>
<p>But parenthesis has precedence over multiplication.</p>

<p>(100 + 50) * 3</p>
<p id="demo1"></p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>When many operations has the same precedence, they are computed from left to right.</p>

<p>100 + 50 - 3</p>
<p id="demo2"></p>


<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 100 + 50 * 3;

// Is the result of example above the same as 150 * 3, or is it the same as 100 + 150?

// Is the addition or the multiplication done first?

// As in traditional school mathematics, the multiplication is done first.

// Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

// And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using parentheses:

// Example
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = (100 + 50) * 3;

// When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first.

// When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction), they are computed from left to right:
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = 100 + 50 - 3;
</script>
