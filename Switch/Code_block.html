<!-- 
Common Code Blocks
Sometimes you will want different switch cases to use the same code.

In this example case 4 and 5 share the same code block, and 0 and 6 share another code block: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript switch</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var text;
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 4:
  case 5:
    text = "Soon it is Weekend";
    break;
  case 0:
  case 6:
    text = "It is Weekend";
    break;
  default:
    text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
</script>

</body>
</html>
