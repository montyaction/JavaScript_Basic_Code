<!-- Null
In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.

Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.

You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.

You can empty an object by setting it to null: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p>Objects can be emptied by setting the value to <b>null</b>.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
person = null;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = typeof person;
</script>

</body>
</html>
