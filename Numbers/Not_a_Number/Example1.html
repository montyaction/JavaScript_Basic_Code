<!-- NaN - Not a Number
NaN is a JavaScript reserved word indicating that a number is not a legal number.

Trying to do arithmetic with a non-numeric string will result in NaN (Not a Number):

Example -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        
        <h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>

        <p>A number divided by a non-numeric string becomes NaN (Not a Number):</p>

        <p id="demo"></p>

        <script>
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 100 / "Apple";
        </script>
        
    </body>
</html>
