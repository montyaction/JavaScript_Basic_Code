<!-- 
JavaScript Block Scope
Variables declared with the var keyword cannot have Block Scope.

Variables declared inside a block {} can be accessed from outside the block.

Example 
{
    var x = 2;
  }
  // x CAN be used here


Before ES2015 JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

Variables declared with the let keyword can have Block Scope.

Variables declared inside a block {} cannot be accessed from outside the block:

Example
{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here

Redeclaring Variables
Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.

Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block:

Example -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        
        <h2>Declaring a Variable Using var</h2>

        <p id="demo"></p>
        <script>
            var x = 19;
            // Here x is 19
            {
                var x =21;
                // Here x is 21
            }
            // Here x is 21
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
