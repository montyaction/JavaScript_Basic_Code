<!--
ECMAScript 2015
ES2015 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provide Block Scope variables (and constants) in JavaScript.

Before ES2015, JavaScript had only two types of scope: Global Scope and Function Scope. 

Global Scope
Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

Example -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        
        <h2>JavaScript Scope</h2>

        <p>A GLOBAL variable can be accessed from any script or function.</p>

        <p id="demo"></p>

        <script>
            
            var bikeName = 'YAMAHA F-150';
            myFunction();

            function myFunction() {
                document.write("I can display " + bikeName)
            }
            
        </script>
    </body>
</html>

Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program -->
