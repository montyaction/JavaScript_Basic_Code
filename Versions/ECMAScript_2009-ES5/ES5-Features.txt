The "use strict" Directive

"use strict" defines that the JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".

With strict mode you can, for example, not use undeclared variables.

You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables.

"use strict" is just a string expression. Old browsers will not throw an error if they don't understand it.
