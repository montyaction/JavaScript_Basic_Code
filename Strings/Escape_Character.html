<!-- Escape Character

Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string:

var x = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called ".

The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.

The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:

Code	Result	Description
\'	    '	    Single quote
\"	    "	    Double quote
\\	    \	    Backslash

The sequence \"  inserts a double quote in a string:

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>The escape sequence \" inserts a double quote in a string.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = "1.We are the so-called \'Vikings\' from the north.";
var y = "2.We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";
var z = "3.We are the so-called \\Vikings\\ from the north.";

// The sequence \'  inserts a single quote in a string:
var a = '4.It\'s alright.';

// The sequence \\  inserts a backslash in a string:
var b = "5.The character \\ is called backslash.";

// \b	    Backspace
var c = "6.The character \b is called backslash.";

// \f	    Form Feed
var d = "7.The character \f is called Form Feed.";

// \n	    New Line
var e = "8.The character \n is called New Line.";

// \r	    Carriage Return
var f = "9.The character \r is called Carriage Return.";

// \t	    Horizontal Tabulator
var j = "10.The character \t is called Horizontal Tabulator.";

//    \v Vertical Tabulator
var h = "11.The character \v is called Vertical Tabulator.";

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x; 
document.write(y +"<br> <br>");
document.write(z +"<br> <br>");
document.write(a +"<br> <br>");
document.write(b +"<br> <br>");
document.write(c +"<br> <br>");
document.write(d +"<br> <br>");
document.write(e +"<br> <br>");
document.write(f +"<br> <br>");
document.write(j +"<br> <br>");
document.write(h +"<br> <br>");
