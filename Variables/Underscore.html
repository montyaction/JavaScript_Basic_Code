<!-- 
JavaScript Underscore (_)
Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:

Example-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        
        <h2>JavaScript Underscore</h2>

        <p>The underscore is treated as a letter in JavaScript names.</p>

        <script>
            var _x = 23;
            var _100 = 7;
            document.write(_x + _100)
        </script>

    </body>
</html>
