Using let and const (ES6)

Before 2015, using the var keyword was the only way to declare a JavaScript variable.

The 2015 version of JavaScript (ES6) allows the use of the const keyword to define a variable that cannot be reassigned, and the let keyword to define a variable with restricted scope.

Because it is a little complicated to describe the difference between these keywords, and because they are not supported in older browsers, the first part of this tutorial will most often use var.


Safari 10 and Edge 14 were the first browsers to fully support ES6:
				
Chrome 58 	Edge 14 	Firefox 54 	Safari 10 	Opera 55
