JavaScript Identifiers

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    Names must begin with a letter
    Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
    Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
    Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
