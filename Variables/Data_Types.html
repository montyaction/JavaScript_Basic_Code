Data Types

JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

In programming, text values are called text strings.

JavaScJavaScript ript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string. -->

<script>
var pi = 3.14;
var person = "John Doe";
var answer = 'Yes I am!';

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = pi + "<br>" + person + "<br>" + answer;
</script>
