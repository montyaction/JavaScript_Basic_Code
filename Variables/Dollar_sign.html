JavaScript Dollar Sign $
Remember that JavaScript identifiers (names) must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)
Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:

Example -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        
        <h2>JavaScript $</h2>

        <p>The dollar sign is treated as a letter in JavaScript names.</p>

        <p id="demo"></p>

        <script>
            var $ = 2;
            var $money = 8;
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = $ + $money;
        </script>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <script>
            var $$$ = "Money hai to hani hai";
            document.write($$$)
        </script>
    </body>
</html>


<!--
Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.

In the JavaScript library jQuery, for instance, the main function $ is used to select HTML elements. In jQuery $("p"); means "select all p elements".
